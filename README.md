# Pagespeed Optimization Project

Pagespeed optimization of index.html and pizza.html

### INSTRUCTIONS

The project is being hosted on [this page](http://sunnyanna.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio).
To check the pagespeed, go to [Google PageSpeed Insights.](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights).
To check the frame-rate and time to resize pizzas, open [pizza.html](http://sunnyanna.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/views/pizza.html) in Chrome and use dev tools.

### GOALS

1. index.html achieves a PageSpeed score of at least 90 for Mobile and Desktop.
2. pizza.html renders with a consistent frame-rate at 60fps when scrolling the page.
3. Time to resize pizzas is less than 5 ms using the pizza size slider on the pizza.html page.

### CHANGES MADE

Changes included streamlining and manipulation of Javascript code for increased processing efficiency and reduction of the size and amount of resources that need downloading.
Grunt plugins were used for image resizing and file minimizing, as well as for pagespeed check on a local server.
