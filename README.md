The key is accessible only after the player fills the whole body of water with stars.

Each time the player reaches the water a star is left behind and the player is moved to the bottom of the board.
Player is then prevented from access to the space occupied by the star.

Each time the player is hit by a bug a rock is created at the collision space and the player is moved to the bottom of the board.
The player is unable to cross the rock.

You lose the game if the player is hit by a bug 5 times or you run out of time.

You can pause or reset the game at any time.
